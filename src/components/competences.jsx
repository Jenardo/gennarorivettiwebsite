                        After graduation I've started developing websites for local stores in my city, such as groiceries and one bar in order to apply what I were studing and rise some money.<br></br>
                        The "experience" I've made during this time dive me in my last Web App project, developed for a Pub in Giugliano, Campania (NA) working mainly on the Back-End Database side but also on UI/UX side.

                    <h2>Certified Apple Developer</h2>

                        <p>
                            During the Apple Developer Academy path I've developed competencies such as Swift language, CocoaPods, UI/UI and Gestalt principles, CBL learning process, Apple product knowledge;<br></br>
                            Beside that I've acquired those that are called "Soft-Skills".
                            Being in a young environment, with people from all over the word, everyone with different competences at different level have really pushed me to do my best in every situation.
